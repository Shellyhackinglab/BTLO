You'll try a source-reading this time!!
The first step is to figure out a whole indexes tree before a source-reading.
You can see two c files written in PHP in the different directories which look like all the same, but you have to prove it.

I relocated them at the same directory and renamed them in order to access with ease.
Then you can use diff command to extract the difference between them.
# diff -s ext_zlib.c source_zlib.c
Now, you can find these are identical files.
