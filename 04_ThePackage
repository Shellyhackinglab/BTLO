I had trouble when unzipping. The same problem with Meta challenge.

Now, I can read info.txt and I got some keywords for example, wifi-hacking device, profile name:jllerenac, related to fruit name...etc.
Then, I searched for "wifi hacking device jllerenac", and I found only one article underbelow easily.
