Q1. Count of Events
I couldn't open the csv file on windows word software, so I used the text file.
I used "lines of Port number" to count how many events included.
# cat BTLO_Bruteforce_Challenge.txt | grep Port: | sort > data_count && wc -l data_count
Now, you can find out how many lines inside it, however, that's not the answer. 
When you take a closer look directly, you can find 4 data which has no information about Network stuffs.
Considering these 4 data, the answer has to be minus 4 instead of all lines from my one-liner.

Q3. 
If your computer was setup in not English, you need to switch to English.
Maybe you cannot get the correct answer on windows because of translation.
And the answer message differs on windows OS from that one from Linux OS, so I recommend you to use Linux OS ow WSL2.
