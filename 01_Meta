#########################

My first trouble is that I couldn't unzip correctly the first image using Lhaplus(ver1.74) on windows.
The message was "Something broken, you cannot open it.", however, I got the second one only.
Then, I tried to another way to unzip this file. When I simply use unzip command, It seems like not suitable for this file.
You can see underbelow.
# unzip -p blto cf~~~~~~~~~.zip
 skipping: uploaded_1.JPG          need PK compat. v5.1 (can do v4.6)
 skipping: uploaded_2.png          need PK compat. v5.1 (can do v4.6)
Built-in functions in my OS is too new to unzip this file.
So, I needed to search another tool supported the old types and found it finally.
# sudo apt-get install p7zip p7zip-full
# 7z x cf~~~~~~~.zip -aoa -pblto
You can see more detail at the bottom of this page.
 
I redirected to other file to analyze easily.
# exiftool uploaded_1.JPG > data_1
# exiftool uploaded_2.png > data_2
The exiftool command is very useful for image information extraction.
You can see answers in the first image.
Or you can use file command which shows more simple info and enough in order to answer some questions excluded the last GPS one.

The most difficult is to figure out the position from GPS and input the correct spelling.
The original ---> 32 deg 40' 3.87" S, 279 deg 29' 31.87" W
Substitute for ---> 32°40'3.87"N 81°29' 31.87"E
And you can see the picture on google map which looks like the second image.
