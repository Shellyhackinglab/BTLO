1. Download a zip-file
2. unzip the file
3. analyze 2 images in it
Let's go !!

My first trouble is that I couldn't unzip correctly the first image using Lhaplus(ver1.74) on windows.
The message was "Something broken, you cannot open it.", however, I got the second one only.
Then, I tried to another way to unzip this file. When I simply use unzip command, It seems like not suitable for this file.
You can see underbelow.
# unzip -p blto cf~~~~~~~~~.zip
 skipping: uploaded_1.JPG          need PK compat. v5.1 (can do v4.6)
 skipping: uploaded_2.png          need PK compat. v5.1 (can do v4.6)
Built-in functions in my OS is too new to unzip this file.
So, I needed to search another tool supported the old types and found it finally.
# sudo apt-get install p7zip p7zip-full
# 7z x cf~~~~~~~.zip -aoa -pblto
You can see more detail at the bottom of this page.
 
I redirected to other file to analyze easily.
# exiftool uploaded_1.JPG > data_1
# exiftool uploaded_2.png > data_2
The exiftool command is very useful for image information extraction.
You can see answers in the first image.
